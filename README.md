# Somali Homograph Database

   ## Project Description
   This repository contains a database of Somali homographs. Homographs are words that share the same spelling but have different meanings. This project aims to compile and analyze Somali homographs to contribute to linguistic research and language learning resources.

   ## Current Status
   The database is currently a work in progress. We have collected over 8,000 Somali homographs with their definitions. The project is open for contributions from linguists, Somali speakers, and anyone interested in language preservation and analysis.

   ## Database Structure
   The database currently consists of the following columns:
   1. Somali_Homograph: The Somali word
   2. Meaning_Index: A numerical index to differentiate between multiple meanings
   3. Somali_Definition: The English translation/definition of the word

   ## How to Contribute
   We welcome contributions to expand and improve this database. Here are some ways you can help:
   1. Add new homographs
   2. Provide additional meanings for existing homographs
   3. Improve or correct existing definitions
   4. Suggest additional data fields (e.g., part of speech, example sentences)
   5. Help with data analysis or visualization

   To contribute:
   1. Fork this repository
   2. Make your changes
   3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your contributions

   ## Future Plans
   - Expand the database structure to include more linguistic information
   - Develop tools for Somali language learners using this database
